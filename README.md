# RbChannels!!

This is a simple Ruby client that lets you talk to the [Channels](https://getchannels.com) app while it's running.

## Installation

You can install RbChannels from Rubygems using `gem install rbchannels`.

## Usage

Just create a new client and give it the host name of the device that Channels is running on. You can optionally pass in a port, which defaults to `57000`.

```ruby
require 'rbchannels'

client = Channels::Client.new("192.168.1.192", 57000)

client.pause
client.resume
client.stop
```

## API

All responses return the current status of Channels. You can get this simply with `client.status`, but every other method will return it as well.

### Status Data

Status data is returned as a simple Hash. Here's an example.

```ruby
{
  "status" => "paused",
  "muted" => false,
  "channel" => {
    "number" => "35.1",
    "name" => "Fox-HD",
    "image_url" => "http://fanc.tmsimg.com/h5/NowShowing/28719/s28719_h5_aa.png"
  },
  "now_playing" => {
    "title" => "The Mick",
    "season_number" => 2,
    "episode_number" => 16,
    "episode_title" => "The Accident",
    "image_url" => "http://fanc.tmsimg.com/assets/p12900954_b_h6_ad.jpg",
    "summary" => "Chip offers to help Sabrina get a fake ID in exchange for a night out with her and her friends."
  }
}
```

### Info

You can fetch 2 sets of information from Channels. Its current status and the
current set of favorite channels.

This returns the result documented above.
